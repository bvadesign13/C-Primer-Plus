Chapter 3 Exercise 6:

The mass of a single molecule of water is about 3.0Ã—10^-23 grams. A quart of
water is about 950 grams. Write a program that requests an amount of water,
in quarts, and displays the number of water molecules in that amount. */

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	float H20_MASS = 3.0e-23;
	float GRAMS_H20_PER_QUART = 950.;
	float quarts;

	printf("Enter an amount of water (in quarts): ");
	scanf("%f", &quarts);
	printf("There are %f molecules in %f quarts of water.\n", quarts * GRAMS_H20_PER_QUART / H20_MASS, quarts);

	return 0;
