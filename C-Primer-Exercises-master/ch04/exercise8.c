Chapter 4 Exercise 8:

Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of miles traveled and
the number of gallons of gasoline consumed. It should then calculate and
display the miles-per-gallon value, showing one place to the right of the
decimal. Next, using the fact that one gallon is about 3.785 liters and one
mile is about 1.609 kilometers, it should convert the mile- per-gallon value
to a liters-per-100-km value, the usual European way of expressing fuel
consumption, and display the result, showing one place to the right of the
decimal. Note that the U. S. scheme measures the distance traveled per amount
of fuel (higher is better), whereas the European scheme measures the amount of
fuel per distance (lower is better). Use symbolic constants (using const or
#define) for the two conversion factors. */
