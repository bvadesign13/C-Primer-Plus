/* C Primer Plus

Chapter 5 Exercise 6:

Now modify the program of Programming Exercise 5 so that it computes the sum of
the squares of the integers. (If you prefer, how much money you receive if you
get $1 the first day, $4 the second day, $9 the third day, and so on. This looks
like a much better deal!) C doesnâ€™t have a squaring function, but you can use the
fact that the square of n is n * n. */

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	int sum, count, max_count;
	sum = 0;
	count = 1;

	printf("How many squares would you like to sum? ");
	scanf("%d", &max_count);
	while (count <= max_count)
	{
		sum = sum + count * count;
		count++;
	}
	printf("The sum of the first %d squares is: %d\n", max_count, sum);

	return 0;
}
