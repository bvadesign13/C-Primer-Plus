// C Primer Plus
// Chapter 13 Exercise 8

// Write a program that takes as command-line arguments a character and zero or
// more filenames. If no arguments follow the character, have the program read
// the standard input. Otherwise, have it open each file in turn and report how
// many times the character appears in each file. The filename and the
// character itself should be reported along with the count. Include error-
// checking to see whether the number of arguments is correct and whether the
// files can be opened. If a file canâ€™t be opened, have the program report that
// fact and go on to the next file.
